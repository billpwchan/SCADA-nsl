<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"><B>Widget-specific</B> <B>Options</B></A></H2>

<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-buttonbackground</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>buttonBackground</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Background</B>
<P>
The background color to be used for the spin buttons.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-buttoncursor</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>buttonCursor</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Cursor</B>
<P>
The cursor to be used when over the spin buttons.
If this is empty (the default), a default cursor
will be used.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-buttondownrelief</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>buttonDownRelief</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Relief</B>
<P>
The relief to be used for the upper spin button.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-buttonuprelief</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>buttonUpRelief</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Relief</B>
<P>
The relief to be used for the lower spin button.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-command</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>command</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Command</B>
<P>
Specifies a Tcl command to invoke whenever a
spinbutton is invoked. The command recognizes several
percent substitutions: <B>%W</B> for the widget path,
<B>%s</B> for the current value of the widget, and <B>%d</B> for
the direction of the button pressed (<B>up</B> or <B>down</B>).
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-format</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>format</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Format</B>
<P>
Specifies an alternate format to use when setting
the string value when using the <B>-from</B> and <B>-to</B>
range. This must be a format specifier of the form
<B>%&lt;pad&gt;.&lt;pad&gt;f</B>, as it will format a floating-point
number.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-from</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>from</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>From</B>
<P>
A floating-point value corresponding to the lowest
value for a spinbox, to be used in conjunction with
<B>-to</B> and <B>-increment</B>. When all are specified correctly,
the spinbox will use these values to control
its contents. This value must be less than
the <B>-to</B> option. If <B>-values</B> is specified, it
supercedes this option.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-invalidcommand</B> <B>or</B> <B>-invcmd</B>
Database Name: <B>invalidCommand</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>InvalidCommand</B>
<P>
Specifies a script to eval when <B>validateCommand</B>
returns 0. Setting it to an empty string disables
this feature (the default). The best use of this
option is to set it to <I>bell</I>. See <B>Validation</B> below
for more information.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-increment</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>increment</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Increment</B>
<P>
A floating-point value specifying the increment.
When used with <B>-from</B> and <B>-to</B>, the value in the widget
will be adjusted by <B>-increment</B> when a spin button
is pressed (up adds the value, down subtracts
the value).
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-state</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>state</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>State</B>
<P>
Specifies one of states for the spinbox: <B>normal</B>,
<B>uneditable</B> or <B>disabled</B>. If the spinbox is disabled
then the value may not be changed using widget
commands and no insertion cursor will be displayed,
even if the input focus is in the widget, and the
spinbox will be displayed with a disabled foreground.
If the spinbox is uneditable, then you can
only interact with it by pressing the spin buttons.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-to</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>to</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>To</B>
<P>
A floating-point value corresponding to the highest
value for the spinbox, to be used in conjunction
with <B>-from</B> and <B>-increment</B>. When all are specified
correctly, the spinbox will use these values to
control its contents. This value must be greater
than the <B>-from</B> option. If <B>-values</B> is specified, it
supercedes this option.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-validate</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>validate</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Validate</B>
<P>
Specifies the mode in which validation should operate:
<B>none</B>, <B>focus</B>, <B>focusin</B>, <B>focusout</B>, <B>key</B>, or <B>all</B>.
It defaults to <B>none</B>. When you want validation, you
must explicitly state which mode you wish to use.
See <B>Validation</B> below for more.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-validatecommand</B> <B>or</B> <B>-vcmd</B>
Database Name: <B>validateCommand</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>ValidateCommand</B>
<P>
Specifies a script to evaluate when you want to
validate the input in the widget. Setting it to an
empty string disables this feature (the default).
Validation occurs according to the value of <B>-validate</B>.
This command must return a valid Tcl boolean
value. If it returns 0 (or the valid Tcl boolean
equivalent) then the value of the widget will not
change and the <B>invalidCommand</B> will be evaluated if
it is set. If it returns 1, then value will be
changed. See <B>Validation</B> below for more information.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-values</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>values</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Values</B>
<P>
Must be a proper list value. If specified, the
spinbox will use these values as to control its
contents, starting with the first value. This
option has precedence over the <B>-from</B> and <B>-to</B> range.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-width</B>
<P>
Database Name: <B>width</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>Width</B>
<P>
Specifies an integer value indicating the desired
width of the spinbox window, in average-size characters
of the widget's font. If the value is less
than or equal to zero, the widget picks a size just
large enough to hold its current text.
<P>
Command-Line Name:<B>-wrap</B><BR>

Database Name: <B>wrap</B><BR>

Database Class: <B>wrap</B>
<P>
Must be a proper boolean value. If on, the spinbox
will wrap around the values of data in the widget.
_________________________________________________________________

<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4"><B>Description</B></A></H2>

<P>
The <B>spinbox</B> command creates a new window (given by the
<I>pathName</I> argument) and makes it into a spinbox widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on
the command line or in the option database to configure
aspects of the spinbox such as its colors, font, and
relief. The <B>spinbox</B> command returns its <I>pathName</I> argument.
At the time this command is invoked, there must not
exist a window named <I>pathName</I>, but <I>pathName</I>'s parent must
exist.
<P>
A spinbox is a widget that displays a one-line text string
and allows that string to be edited using widget commands
described below, which are typically bound to keystrokes
and mouse actions. Also created are two <I>spin</I> buttons that
can modify the data in the text string. This is handled
automatically when using the right combination of options.
When first created, a spinbox's string is empty. A portion
of the spinbox may be selected as described below.
If a spinbox is exporting its selection (see the <B>exportSelection</B>
option), then it will observe the standard protocols
for handling the selection; spinbox selections are
available as type <B>STRING</B>. Spinboxes also observe the
standard Tk rules for dealing with the input focus. When
a spinbox has the input focus it displays an <I>insertion</I>
<I>cursor</I> to indicate where new characters will be inserted.
<P>
Spinboxes are capable of displaying strings that are too
long to fit entirely within the widget's window. In this
case, only a portion of the string will be displayed; commands
described below may be used to change the view in
the window. Spinboxes use the standard <B>xScrollCommand</B>
mechanism for interacting with scrollbars (see the
description of the <B>xScrollCommand</B> option for details).
They also support scanning, as described below.

<H2><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5"><B>Validation</B></A></H2>

<P>
Validation works by setting the <B>validateCommand</B> option to
a script which will be evaluated according to the <B>validate</B>
option as follows:

<DL>

<DT><B>none</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>     Default. This means no validation will occur.
</DD>

<DT><B>focus</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>    <B>validateCommand</B> will be called when the spinbox
receives or loses focus.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
<B>focusin</B> <B>validateCommand</B> will be called when the spinbox
receives focus.
<P>
<B>focusout</B> <B>validateCommand</B> will be called when the spinbox
loses focus.

<DL>

<DT><B>key</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>      <B>validateCommand</B> will be called when the spinbox
is edited.
</DD>

<DT><B>all</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>      <B>validateCommand</B> will be called for all above
conditions.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
It is posible to perform percent substitutions on the <B>validateCommand</B>
and <B>invalidCommand</B>, just as you would in a
<B>bind</B> script. The following substitutions are recognized:

<DL>

<DT><B>%d</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>Type of action: 1 for <B>insert</B>, 0 for <B>delete</B>, or -1 for
focus, forced or textvariable validation.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
<B>%i</B> Index of char string to be inserted/deleted, if any,
otherwise -1.
<P>
<B>%P</B> The value of the spinbox should edition occur. If
you are configuring the spinbox widget to have a new
textvariable, this will be the value of that
textvariable.

<DL>

<DT><B>%s</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>The current value of spinbox before edition.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
<B>%S</B> The text string being inserted/deleted, if any. Otherwise
it is an empty string.

<DL>

<DT><B>%v</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>The type of validation currently set.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
<B>%V</B> The type of validation that triggered the callback
(key, focusin, focusout, forced).

<DL>

<DT><B>%W</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>The name of the spinbox widget.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
In general, the <B>textVariable</B> and <B>validateCommand</B> can be
dangerous to mix. Any problems have been overcome so that
using the <B>validateCommand</B> will not interfere with the
traditional behavior of the spinbox widget. Using the
<B>textVariable</B> for read-only purposes will never cause problems.
The danger comes when you try set the <B>textVariable</B>
to something that the <B>validateCommand</B> would not accept,
which causes <B>validate</B> to become <I>none</I> (the <B>invalidCommand</B>
will not be triggered). The same happens when an error
occurs evaluating the <B>validateCommand</B>.
<P>
Primarily, an error will occur when the <B>validateCommand</B> or
<B>invalidCommand</B> encounters an error in its script while
evaluating or <B>validateCommand</B> does not return a valid Tcl
boolean value. The <B>validate</B> option will also set itself
to <B>none</B> when you edit the spinbox widget from within
either the <B>validateCommand</B> or the <B>invalidCommand</B>. Such
editions will override the one that was being validated.
If you wish to edit the value of the widget during validation
and still have the <B>validate</B> option set, you should
include the command<BR>

<I>%W</I> <I>config</I> <I>-validate</I> <I>%v</I><BR>

in the <B>validateCommand</B> or <B>invalidCommand</B> (whichever one
you were editing the spinbox widget from). It is also
recommended to not set an associated <B>textVariable</B> during
validation, as that can cause the spinbox widget to become
out of sync with the <B>textVariable</B>.

<H2><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#toc6"><B>Widget</B> <B>Command</B></A></H2>

<P>
The <B>spinbox</B> command creates a new Tcl command whose name
is <I>pathName</I>. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget. It has the following general
form:<BR>

<I>pathName</I> <I>option</I> ?<I>arg</I> <I>arg</I> <I>...</I>?<BR>

<I>Option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s determine the exact behavior of the
command.
<P>
Many of the widget commands for spinboxes take one or more
indices as arguments. An index specifies a particular
character in the spinbox's string, in any of the following
ways:

<DL>

<DT><I>number</I> </DT></DT>
<DD>     Specifies the character as a numerical index,
where 0 corresponds to the first character in
the string.
</DD>

<DT><B>anchor</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>     Indicates the anchor point for the selection,
which is set with the <B>select</B> <B>from</B> and <B>select</B>
<B>adjust</B> widget commands.
</DD>

<DT><B>end</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>        Indicates the character just after the last
one in the spinbox's string. This is equivalent
to specifying a numerical index equal to
the length of the spinbox's string.
</DD>

<DT><B>insert</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>     Indicates the character adjacent to and
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
immediately following the insertion cursor.
<P>
<B>sel.first</B> Indicates the first character in the selection.
It is an error to use this form if the
selection isn't in the spinbox window.

<DL>

<DT><B>sel.last</B> </DT></DT>
<DD>   Indicates the character just after the last
one in the selection. It is an error to use
this form if the selection isn't in the spinbox
window.
</DD>

<DT><B>@</B><I>number</I> </DT></DT>
<DD>    In this form, <I>number</I> is treated as an x-coordinate
in the spinbox's window; the character
spanning that x-coordinate is used. For example,
``<B>@0</B>'' indicates the left-most character
in the window.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above, e.g.
``<B>e</B>'' or ``<B>sel.f</B>''. In general, out-of-range indices are
automatically rounded to the nearest legal value.
<P>
The following commands are possible for spinbox widgets:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>bbox</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Returns a list of four numbers describing the
bounding box of the character given by <I>index</I>. The
first two elements of the list give the x and y
coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen
area covered by the character (in pixels relative
to the widget) and the last two elements give the
width and height of the character, in pixels. The
bounding box may refer to a region outside the visible
area of the window.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>cget</B> <I>option</I><BR>

Returns the current value of the configuration
option given by <I>option</I>. <I>Option</I> may have any of the
values accepted by the <B>spinbox</B> command.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>configure</B> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> <I>...</I>?
Query or modify the configuration options of the
widget. If no <I>option</I> is specified, returns a list
describing all of the available options for <I>path</I><B>_N</B><I>ame</I>
(see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the
format of this list). If <I>option</I> is specified with
no <I>value</I>, then the command returns a list describing
the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value
returned if no <I>option</I> is specified). If one or
more <I>option-value</I> pairs are specified, then the
command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
the given value(s); in this case the command
returns an empty string. <I>Option</I> may have any of
the values accepted by the <B>spinbox</B> command.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <I>first</I> ?<I>last</I>?<BR>

Delete one or more elements of the spinbox. <I>First</I>
is the index of the first character to delete, and
<I>last</I> is the index of the character just after the
last one to delete. If <I>last</I> isn't specified it
defaults to <I>first</I>+1, i.e. a single character is
deleted. This command returns an empty string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>get</B><BR>

Returns the spinbox's string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>icursor</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Arrange for the insertion cursor to be displayed
just before the character given by <I>index</I>. Returns
an empty string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>identify</B> <I>x</I> <I>y</I><BR>

Returns the name of the window element corresponding
to coordinates <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> in the spinbox. Return
value is one of: <B>none</B>, <B>spindown</B>, <B>spinup</B>, <B>entry</B>.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>index</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Returns the numerical index corresponding to <I>index</I>.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>insert</B> <I>index</I> <I>string</I><BR>

Insert the characters of <I>string</I> just before the
character indicated by <I>index</I>. Returns an empty
string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>invoke</B> <I>element</I><BR>

Causes the specified element, either <B>spindown</B> or
<B>spinup</B>, to be invoked, triggering the action associated
with it.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>scan</B> <I>option</I> <I>args</I><BR>

This command is used to implement scanning on spinboxes.
It has two forms, depending on <I>option</I>:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>scan</B> <B>mark</B> <I>x</I><BR>

Records <I>x</I> and the current view in the spinbox
window; used in conjunction with later
<B>scan</B> <B>dragto</B> commands. Typically this command
is associated with a mouse button press
in the widget. It returns an empty string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>scan</B> <B>dragto</B> <I>x</I><BR>

This command computes the difference between
its <I>x</I> argument and the <I>x</I> argument to the
last <B>scan</B> <B>mark</B> command for the widget. It
then adjusts the view left or right by 10
times the difference in x-coordinates. This
command is typically associated with mouse
motion events in the widget, to produce the
effect of dragging the spinbox at high speed
through the window. The return value is an
empty string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <I>option</I> <I>arg</I><BR>

This command is used to adjust the selection within
a spinbox. It has several forms, depending on
<I>option</I>:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>adjust</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Locate the end of the selection nearest to
the character given by <I>index</I>, and adjust
that end of the selection to be at <I>index</I>
(i.e including but not going beyond <I>index</I>).
The other end of the selection is made the
anchor point for future <B>select</B> <B>to</B> commands.
If the selection isn't currently in the
spinbox, then a new selection is created to
include the characters between <I>index</I> and the
most recent selection anchor point, inclusive.
Returns an empty string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>clear</B><BR>

Clear the selection if it is currently in
this widget. If the selection isn't in this
widget then the command has no effect.
Returns an empty string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>element</B> ?<I>element</I>?
Sets or gets the currently selected element.
If a spinbutton element is specified, it
will be displayed depressed.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>from</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Set the selection anchor point to just
before the character given by <I>index</I>.
Doesn't change the selection. Returns an
empty string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>present</B><BR>

Returns 1 if there is are characters
selected in the spinbox, 0 if nothing is
selected.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>range</B> <I>start</I> <I>end</I>
Sets the selection to include the characters
starting with the one indexed by <I>start</I> and
ending with the one just before <I>end</I>. If <I>end</I>
refers to the same character as <I>start</I> or an
earlier one, then the spinbox's selection is
cleared.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>selection</B> <B>to</B> <I>index</I><BR>

If <I>index</I> is before the anchor point, set the
selection to the characters from <I>index</I> up to
but not including the anchor point. If
<I>index</I> is the same as the anchor point, do
nothing. If <I>index</I> is after the anchor
point, set the selection to the characters
from the anchor point up to but not including
<I>index</I>. The anchor point is determined
by the most recent <B>select</B> <B>from</B> or <B>select</B>
<B>adjust</B> command in this widget. If the
selection isn't in this widget then a new
selection is created using the most recent
anchor point specified for the widget.
Returns an empty string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>set</B> ?<I>string</I>?<BR>

If <I>string</I> is specified, the spinbox will try and
set it to this value, otherwise it just returns the
spinbox's string. If validation is on, it will
occur when setting the string.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>validate</B><BR>

This command is used to force an evaluation of the
<B>validateCommand</B> independent of the conditions specified
by the <B>validate</B> option. This is done by temporarily
setting the <B>validate</B> option to <B>all</B>. It
returns 0 or 1.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>xview</B> <I>args</I><BR>

This command is used to query and change the horizontal
position of the text in the widget's window.
It can take any of the following forms:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>xview</B><BR>

Returns a list containing two elements.
Each element is a real fraction between 0
and 1; together they describe the horizontal
span that is visible in the window. For
example, if the first element is .2 and the
second element is .6, 20% of the spinbox's
text is off-screen to the left, the middle
40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the
text is off-screen to the right. These are
the same values passed to scrollbars via the
<B>-xscrollcommand</B> option.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>xview</B> <I>index</I><BR>

Adjusts the view in the window so that the
character given by <I>index</I> is displayed at the
left edge of the window.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>xview</B> <B>moveto</B> <I>fraction</I><BR>

Adjusts the view in the window so that the
character <I>fraction</I> of the way through the
text appears at the left edge of the window.
<I>Fraction</I> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>xview</B> <B>scroll</B> <I>number</I> <I>what</I>
This command shifts the view in the window
left or right according to <I>number</I> and <I>what</I>.
<I>Number</I> must be an integer. <I>What</I> must be
either <B>units</B> or <B>pages</B> or an abbreviation of
one of these. If <I>what</I> is <B>units</B>, the view
adjusts left or right by <I>number</I> averagewidth
characters on the display; if it is
<B>pages</B> then the view adjusts by <I>number</I>
screenfuls. If <I>number</I> is negative then
characters farther to the left become visible;
if it is positive then characters farther
to the right become visible.

<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#toc7"><B>Default</B> <B>Bindings</B></A></H2>

<P>
Tk automatically creates class bindings for spinboxes that
give them the following default behavior. In the descriptions
below, ``word'' refers to a contiguous group of letters,
digits, or ``_'' characters, or any single character
other than these.

<DL>

<DT>[1] </DT></DT>
<DD>   Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion
cursor just before the character underneath the
mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this widget,
and clears any selection in the widget. Dragging
with mouse button 1 strokes out a selection between
the insertion cursor and the character under the
mouse.
</DD>

<DT>[2] </DT></DT>
<DD>   Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the
word under the mouse and positions the insertion
cursor at the beginning of the word. Dragging
after a double click will stroke out a selection
consisting of whole words.
</DD>

<DT>[3] </DT></DT>
<DD>   Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of
the text in the spinbox and positions the insertion
cursor before the first character.
</DD>

<DT>[4] </DT></DT>
<DD>   The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging
with mouse button 1 while the Shift key is
down; this will adjust the end of the selection
that was nearest to the mouse cursor when button 1
was pressed. If the button is double-clicked
before dragging then the selection will be adjusted
in units of whole words.
</DD>

<DT>[5] </DT></DT>
<DD>   Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down
will position the insertion cursor in the spinbox
without affecting the selection.
</DD>

<DT>[6] </DT></DT>
<DD>   If any normal printing characters are typed in a
spinbox, they are inserted at the point of the
insertion cursor.
</DD>

<DT>[7] </DT></DT>
<DD>   The view in the spinbox can be adjusted by dragging
with mouse button 2. If mouse button 2 is clicked
without moving the mouse, the selection is copied
into the spinbox at the position of the mouse cursor.
</DD>

<DT>[8] </DT></DT>
<DD>   If the mouse is dragged out of the spinbox on the
left or right sides while button 1 is pressed, the
spinbox will automatically scroll to make more text
visible (if there is more text off-screen on the
side where the mouse left the window).
</DD>

<DT>[9] </DT></DT>
<DD>   The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor
one character to the left or right; they also
clear any selection in the spinbox and set the
selection anchor. If Left or Right is typed with
the Shift key down, then the insertion cursor moves
and the selection is extended to include the new
character. Control-Left and Control-Right move the
insertion cursor by words, and Control-Shift-Left
and Control-Shift-Right move the insertion cursor
by words and also extend the selection. Control-b
and Control-f behave the same as Left and Right,
respectively. Meta-b and Meta-f behave the same as
Control-Left and Control-Right, respectively.
</DD>

<DT>[10] </DT></DT>
<DD>The Home key, or Control-a, will move the insertion
cursor to the beginning of the spinbox and clear
any selection in the spinbox. Shift-Home moves the
insertion cursor to the beginning of the spinbox
and also extends the selection to that point.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
[11] The End key, or Control-e, will move the insertion
cursor to the end of the spinbox and clear any
selection in the spinbox. Shift-End moves the cursor
to the end and extends the selection to that
point.
<P>
[12] The Select key and Control-Space set the selection
anchor to the position of the insertion cursor.
They don't affect the current selection. ShiftSelect
and Control-Shift-Space adjust the selection
to the current position of the insertion cursor,
selecting from the anchor to the insertion cursor
if there was not any selection previously.

<DL>

<DT>[13] </DT></DT>
<DD>Control-/ selects all the text in the spinbox.
</DD>

<DT>[14] </DT></DT>
<DD>Control-\ clears any selection in the spinbox.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
[15] The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations)
or Meta-w copies the selection in the widget
to the clipboard, if there is a selection.

<DL>

<DT>[16] </DT></DT>
<DD>The F20 key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations)
or Control-w copies the selection in the widget to
the clipboard and deletes the selection. If there
is no selection in the widget then these keys have
no effect.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
[17] The F18 key (labelled Paste on many Sun workstations)
or Control-y inserts the contents of the
clipboard at the position of the insertion cursor.
<P>
[18] The Delete key deletes the selection, if there is
one in the spinbox. If there is no selection, it
deletes the character to the right of the insertion
cursor.
<P>
[19] The BackSpace key and Control-h delete the selection,
if there is one in the spinbox. If there is
no selection, it deletes the character to the left
of the insertion cursor.

<DL>

<DT>[20] </DT></DT>
<DD>Control-d deletes the character to the right of the
insertion cursor.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
[21] Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the insertion
cursor.
<P>
[22] Control-k deletes all the characters to the right
of the insertion cursor.
<P>
[23] Control-t reverses the order of the two characters
to the right of the insertion cursor.
<P>
If the spinbox is disabled using the <B>-state</B> option, then
the spinbox's view can still be adjusted and text in the
spinbox can still be selected, but no insertion cursor
will be displayed and no text modifications will take
place.
<P>
The behavior of spinboxes can be changed by defining new
bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the class
bindings.
