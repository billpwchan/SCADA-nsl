<P>
The angle at which the scale of the dial will start. The
value is in degrees. Zero is at the top and the angle
increases clockwise, just like a compass. If you want the
scale to start at the left, use a negative value, not the
value above 180 degrees. Some interactions with the dial
cause its value to change by ``large'' increments; this
option specifies the size of the large increments. If
specified as 0, the large increments default to 1/10 the
range of the dial. Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command
to invoke whenever the dial's value is changed via a widget
command. The actual command consists of this option
followed by a space and a real number indicating the new
value of the dial. Specifies whether the value for the
dial should be constrained to the given <B>from</B> and <B>to</B> values
and the <B>resolution</B>. If true, the it is limited to the
value range and to the nearest resolution. Otherwise,
only the displayed value (which is always constrained) is
constrained. Defaults to 0. Specifies the border width
for the inner dial. Defaults to 3. Specifies the color
for the inner dial. Defaults to the normal background.
Specifies the relief for the inner dial. Defaults to the
raised. An integer specifying how many significant digits
should be retained when converting the value of the dial
to a string. If the number is less than or equal to zero,
then the dial picks the smallest value that guarantees
that every possible dial position prints as a different
string. The angle at which the scale of the dial will
end. The value is in degrees. Zero is at the top and the
angle increases clockwise, just like a compass. A real
value corresponding to the counterclockwise-most end of
the dial. A string to display as a label for the dial.
The label is displayed above the dial. If the option is
specified as an empty string, no label is displayed.
Specifies the color for the needle. Defaults to black.
Specifies a type for the needle: <B>arc</B>, <B>line</B>, or <B>triangle</B>.
<B>arc</B> draws the needle as a filled arc from the <B>from</B> value
to the current value. <B>line</B> draws the needle as a thick
line at the value. <B>triangle</B> draws the needle as a thin
triangle at the value (compass style). Defaults to <B>line</B>.
Must be a real value. Determines the spacing between
minor tick marks, those without a numerical value or tag.
<P>
These ticks are also slightly smaller. If 0 (default), no
minor tick marks will be displayed. See <B>tickinterval</B> for
more details. Specifies the desired radius of the central
dial of the dial in screen units (i.e. any form acceptable
to Tk_GetPixels). A real value specifying the resolution
for the dial. If this value is greater than zero then the
dial's value will always be rounded to an even multiple of
this value, as will tick marks and the endpoints of the
dial. If the value is less than zero then no rounding
occurs. Defaults to 1 (i.e., the value will be integral).
Specifies a boolean value indicating whether or not the
current value of the dial is to be displayed. Specifies
which tags to display at normal tick marks on the dial:
<B>value</B> (default), <B>label</B>, <B>both</B>, or <B>none</B>. If <B>value</B>, then the
value is always displayed. If <B>label</B>, then only labels
specified by the <B>tag</B> command are displayed. <B>all</B> refers to
both of the above, and <B>none</B> causes neither to be displayed.
Specifies one of three states for the dial: <B>normal</B>,
<B>active</B>, or <B>disabled</B>. If the dial is disabled then
the value may not be changed and the dial won't activate.
If the dial is active, the dial is displayed using the
color specified by the <B>activeBackground</B> option. Specifies
the color to be used for the ticks. Defaults to black.
Must be a real value. Determines the spacing between tick
marks displayed with their numeric value or a tag around
the dial. This spacing is calculated at <B>tickinterval</B>
counts around the dial between the <B>from</B> and <B>to</B> values. If
<B>from</B> is 0.0 and <B>to</B> is 100.0, then a <B>tickinterval</B> of 10.0
will place 11 ticks (at 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, ...) on the dial.
If 0 (default), no tick marks will be displayed. Specifies
the width of the line that ticks are displayed with.
0, the default, means a simple line. If you don't wish to
display ticks, set the tick intervals to 0. Specifies a
real value corresponding to the clockwise-most end of the
dial. This value may be either less than or greater than
the <B>from</B> option. Specifies the name of a global variable
to link to the dial. Whenever the value of the variable
changes, the dial will update to reflect this value.
Whenever the dial is manipulated interactively, the variable
will be modified to reflect the dial's new value.
<P>
Further options are handled by the dial widget in order to
maintain 100% compatibility with the scale widget. These
options are not guaranteed to translate correctly for use
by the dial, but they will not cause an error in code.

<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"><B>Description</B></A></H2>

<P>
The <B>dial</B> command creates a new window (given by the <I>path</I><B>_N</B><I>ame</I>
argument) and makes it into a dial widget. Additional
options, described above, may be specified on the
command line or in the option database to configure
aspects of the dial such as its colors and relief. The
<B>dial</B> command returns its <I>pathName</I> argument. At the time
this command is invoked, there must not exist a window
named <I>pathName</I>, but <I>pathName</I>'s parent must exist.
<P>
A dial is a widget that displays a circular <I>dial</I> with a
small <I>mark</I>. The position of the dial selects a particular
real value of the scale which is determined by the <B>from</B>,
<B>to</B>, and <B>resolution</B> options. The dial may be turned (and
hence the dial's value changed) with the mouse or keyboard
as described in the BINDINGS section below. Whenever the
dial's value is changed, a Tcl command is invoked (using
the <B>command</B> option) to notify other interested widgets of
the change. In addition, the value of the dial can be
linked to a Tcl variable (using the <B>variable</B> option), so
that changes in either are reflected in the other. The
dial is modelled after the Tk <B>scale</B> widget and is 100%
compatible with the commands and options for a scale.
<P>
Five annotations may be displayed in a dial widget: a
label appearing at the top left of the widget, a number
displaying the current value just below the dial, a collection
of major tick marks, numerical or string labels
next to the major tick marks and a collection of minor
tick marks. Each of these five annotations may be enabled
or disabled using the configuration options.

<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4"><B>Widget</B> <B>Command</B></A></H2>

<P>
The <B>dial</B> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
<I>pathName</I>. This command may be used to invoke various
operations on the widget. It has the following general
form: <I>pathName</I> <I>option</I> ?<I>arg</I> <I>arg</I> <I>...</I>? <I>Option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s
determine the exact behavior of the command. The following
commands are possible for dial widgets:
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>cget</B> <I>option</I><BR>

Returns the current value of the configuration
option given by <I>option</I>. <I>Option</I> may have any of the
values accepted by the <B>dial</B> command.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>configure</B> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> <I>...</I>?
Query or modify the configuration options of the
widget. If no <I>option</I> is specified, returns a list
describing all of the available options for <I>path</I><B>_N</B><I>ame</I>
(see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the
format of this list). If <I>option</I> is specified with
no <I>value</I>, then the command returns a list describing
the one named option (this list will be identical
to the corresponding sublist of the value
returned if no <I>option</I> is specified). If one or
more <I>option-value</I> pairs are specified, then the
command modifies the given widget option(s) to have
the given value(s); in this case the command
returns an empty string. <I>Option</I> may have any of
the values accepted by the <B>dial</B> command.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>coords</B> ?<I>value</I>?<BR>

Returns a list whose elements are the x and y coordinates
of the point along the radius of the dial
that corresponds to <I>value</I>. If <I>value</I> is omitted
then the dial's current value is used.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>get</B> ?<I>x</I> <I>y</I>?<BR>

If <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> are omitted, returns the current value
of the dial. If <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> are specified, they give
pixel coordinates within the widget; the command
returns the dial value corresponding to the given
pixel.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>identify</B> <I>x</I> <I>y</I><BR>

Returns a string indicating what part of the dial
lies under the coordinates given by <I>x</I> and <I>y</I>. A
return value of <B>dial</B> means that the point is over
the dial; <B>left</B> means that the point is to the left
of the dial, and <B>right</B> means that the point is to
the right of the dial.
<P>
<I>pathName</I> <B>label</B> ?<I>-constrain</I>? ?<I>value</I>? ?<I>string</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>string</I>
<I>...</I>?<BR>

This command will associate a string label with a
specific value. The value should correspond to a
major tick value. It is important that the correct
resolution is used for the value (constrained by
the <B>tickinterval</B>), as the label will otherwise not
be shown. You can use the <I>-constrain</I> option to
cause the given value to be constrained to a valid
tick value, ensuring that the label will be displayed.
This means that given values are open to
be changed. Constraining is bound to the current
value of <B>tickinterval</B>. When this value changes, so
would the constraints. However, constrained tags
are not tracked to the change in <B>tickinterval</B>, so
changing that could cause tags to not be displayed.
All the known labels can be seen when no arguments
are given. If only a value is given, then the
label for that value will be shown, if any. Otherwise,
each given value will be assigned the given
string. Labels are shown when specified by the
<B>showtags</B> option. <I>pathName</I> <B>set</B> ?<I>value</I>? This command
is invoked to change the current value of the
dial, and hence the orientation of the dial. <I>Value</I>
gives the new value for the dial. If no value is
given, this behaves like a get and simply returns
the current value of the dial. The set command has
no effect if the dial is disabled.

<H2><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5"><B>Bindings</B></A></H2>

<P>
Tk automatically creates class bindings for dials that
give them the following default behavior.

<DL>

<DT>[1] </DT></DT>
<DD>   If button 1 is pressed at the area around the dial,
the dial's value will be incremented or decremented
by the value of the <B>resolution</B> option. If you press
left of the dial, the dial will turn counterclockwise;
if you press at the right it turns clockwise.
If the button is held down, the action autorepeats.
</DD>

<DT>[2] </DT></DT>
<DD>   If button 1 is pressed over the dial, the dial is
turned towards the mouse cursor. If the button is
held down, the dial orientation can be dragged with
the mouse.
</DD>

<DT>[3] </DT></DT>
<DD>   If button 1 is pressed at the surrounding with the
Control key down, the dial turns all the way to the
end of its range. If the cursor was at the left, it
goes to the lower limit; if it was at the right, it
goes to the upper limit.
</DD>

<DT>[4] </DT></DT>
<DD>   The Down and Left keys turn the dial counterclockwise
by the value of the <B>resolution</B> option.
</DD>

<DT>[5] </DT></DT>
<DD>   The Up and Right keys turn the dial clockwise by
the value of the <B>resolution</B> option.
</DD>

<DT>[6] </DT></DT>
<DD>   Control-Down and Control-Left turn the dial counterclockwise
by the value of the <B>bigIncrement</B>
option.
</DD>

<DT>[7] </DT></DT>
<DD>   Control-Up and Control-Right turn the dial clockwise
by the value of the <B>bigIncrement</B> option.
</DD>

<DT>[8] </DT></DT>
<DD>   Home turns the dial to the lower end of its range.
</DD>

<DT>[9] </DT></DT>
<DD>   End moves the dial to the higher end of its range.
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
If the dial is disabled using the <B>state</B> option then none
of the above bindings have any effect.
<P>
The behavior of dials can be changed by defining new bindings
for individual widgets or by redefining the class
bindings.
